<h1>Simon Says Memory Game for the UCFK</h1>

<h3>General Description</h3>
<p>
This is a Simon Says Memory Game, players must set sequences using the navswitch that the other player must memorise and repeat.
With each successful round the number of directions to enter for a sequence increases until it hits the maximum of 15. A player wins
when the other player cannot successfully repeat the sequence that was set. Step by step instructions are detailed below.

<ol>
	<li>After programming the UCFK a title screen will play
	<li>When the 'Hold to Host' screen appears one player must hold the navswitch in the push position until 'Your turn' is displayed.
	<li>The other players display will go blank once it is synced.
	<li>Next a number will flash on the screen. This is the number of directions to press on the navswitch to set your sequence.
	<li>The sequence you set will then flash on the other players screen.
	<li>The other player must then repeat the sequence that was shown on screen.
	<li>If the player correctly sets the sequence then they get to set a sequence for you to repeat. (Repeat from step 3)
	If the other player fails to correctly enter the sequence then the game is over and you have won. Both boards will return to the title
	screen.
